# B-Spline Curve Simulator

This project was developed as a part of a university assignment in a Computer Graphics course. The goal of this project was to simulate B-spline curves, allowing users to interactively plot, modify, and visualize the effects of control points on the curve.

## Features

- **Plot and Move Control Points:** 
  - Left-click to add control points.
  - Drag to move control points.
  - Right-click to delete control points.
  
- **Debug Mode:**
  - Press the `D` key to toggle debug mode on and off.
  - In debug mode, underlying Bezier curves and lines used in the B-spline's calculation are visible.

- **Zooming:**
  - Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the curve.

## Build and Run Instructions

To build and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository:**
   - Download the repository as a ZIP file and unzip it to your desired location.

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Launch the project by opening the `dev.code-workspace` file in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Configure and Build:**
   - Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
   - Run the "Configure" task to set up the build environment.
   - Run the "Build" task to compile the project. This will output the `app.exe` file into the `build/bin/` folder.

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Navigate to the `build/bin/` folder and launch `app.exe` to start the B-spline simulation.

## Tools Used

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLFW**
